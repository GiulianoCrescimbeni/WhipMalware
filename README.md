# WhipMalware (Easy Shellcode)
A simple malware to take control of the victim's computer

# Important
Use the following content for pratical purpose, do not use it without the consent of the victim's computer owner and don't steal someone privacy.

So now, let's go ahed to understand what it is...

**The malware works only on windows operating system**
## What is a Shellcode?
A shellcode is a small piece of code that can provide you the full access to the victim's console. Usually it is accompanied with a **Payload**, a mechanism that allows you to inject the shellcode into a computer. In this repository you will find just the shellcode, but a simple usb stick will work as well.

## How to set-up and use the malware
Using the malware is pretty simple, but you need to follow this few steps to get it to work
First of all you will need a **server** to run the script properly. You just need a vps or any kind of server to have the full access to the victim's computer wherever you are.

The first thing to do is copying "whip.py" in any folder of your server and then run it. If you are connected trough remote desktop you will need a simple double click on it, instead if you are connected trough SSH you will need to send the following command in the malware directory:

```py whip.py ```

Then a message saying ``` Whip Started! ``` will appear on your screen. This file is made to handle the connection with the victim and guarantee an interface to communicate with the victim's console, it is the core of the shellcode. Now what you want to do is setting up the real malware file. To do this you need to open "slave.py" and modify the line: 
```host = "Your ip address"```
pasting your server address.
Now you have to copy this file on the victim's pc and run it. You can copy it as a .py file or as an executable. To make it a .exe file you can follow my guide at the end of the read me.

Now, once you have copied and runned the file on the victim's computer a line saying ```Slave connected``` will appear on the server, and then you will enter in the "Console Mode" that work as the classic windows console and sends command remotely to the victim's pc. Now you can open programs, websites, turning of the pc, it's all on you. Before closing the whip.py file on the server you need to send a "q" command to close properly the connection without any bugs.

## How to build a .exe file from the slave
To build an executable file of the slave what you need to do is simply installing a tool on your pc. Open the command prompt and paste the following line:

```pip install pyinstaller```

After the installation what you want to do is move the slave.py file into a folder, go to the folder with the command prompt and paste the following command to start the build:

```pyinstaller --onefile slave.py```

Once you have done this, the tool will create some files and, in the "dist" folder, you will find the "slave.exe" file that you need.
